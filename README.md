Submitted by: **Farid Ramos**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Total accounts for 5 people
## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories: The 1st GIF is demonstrating the basic functionality of the app such as getting the tip and the total split up to 5 people. It also demonstrates app saving the bill amount for 10 minutes so that the user does not have to retype the bill if the closed and opened within the timeframe, it also shows the app's ability to set a default tip percentage that the app will remember. The 2nd GIF demonstrates the app's ability to change currency based on the user's region.

## Notes

This was the 1st ever iOS app I have ever developed so I struggled getting the hang of Swift's syntax as well as understanding some of the implementation, but overall it was a fun process. I went alongside the video tutorial given to us by CodePath and from there changed the UI to look more appealing. I did have trouble understanding how the change in currency symbol would work as some guides online used outdated implementations in their examples, but I was able to adapt them to the current Swift standard. To be honest, for being my first app, I felt fairly comfortable developing on Xcode and with Swift as oppose to developing with Android Studio and Java for the first time.
